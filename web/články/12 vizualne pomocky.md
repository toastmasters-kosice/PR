USING VISUAL AIDS EFFECTIVELY
Visual aids add interest to any presentation and help your audience retain information. You are
encouraged to use them. If you plan to use the PowerPoint slides for this presentation as visual aids,
you will need a data projector, a laptop computer, a table to support them, and a screen for viewing.
In the outline, there are indications for placement of the PowerPoint slides. Each is numbered.
For example, V1 refers to the first visual.
Please note that the first slide in the PowerPoint show is a title slide and is not included in this
numbering system.
If you cannot arrange for projection equipment but still would like to use visuals, you may copy
the material on the visuals onto a flipchart. Do this before the presentation. Use a heavy marking
pen that does not seep through the paper, and write on every third or fourth page so succeed-
ing visuals will not show through. Also, make your letters large and heavy with plenty of space
between them.
Follow these tips when using visual aids:
4Set them up and test them before the meeting begins. Place them so they are easily visible
to listeners. Place your projector so it projects a large, high, undistorted image on the screen.
Focus the image.
4Bring spare equipment, including a projector bulb, extension cord, extra marking pens, etc.
4Display your visuals only when they are needed. If you are using a flipchart, flip the page back
out of view when you are finished with it.
4Remember not to stand between the screen or flipchart and your audience or you will block
their view.
4Maintain eye contact with your listeners. Do not talk to the screen or flipchart. If you must turn
your back to point out something, pause as you point it out, and then resume speaking only
after you are once again facing your audience.
